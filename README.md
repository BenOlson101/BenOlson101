* [Project 1](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/beyonce/spotify-analysis74651/home?session=6546818436368  ) - ‚ÄúHave you listened to the new album? I can't wait to hear this song in the club, it‚Äôs so good‚Äù. Music is a way people connect to one another, and there is a way to analytically know why a specific song connects to more listeners than others. In this project, we analyzed data from the music-streaming industry leader, Spotify. Our database application and analysis may be useful to artists, record labels, students, or average music lovers.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ
